      <h1 class="text-center mt-5 mb-3">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h3 class="h6 text-center mb-5">Updated December 26, 2025</h3>
      <p>
        Sailer does not automatically collect any personal data and does not use
        third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or SDKs. However, if
        you voluntarily provide feedback or request support, during that
        process, your personal data may be collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how we, the developer of this App,
        collect, use, and share your personal data.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 py-3 mt-4">What Is Personal Data?</h2>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we consider any data that
        relates to an identified or identifiable individual as “personal data,”
        no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly
        identifies you — such as your name, your date of birth — is personal
        data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can
        reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your
        device, your location data — is personal data.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 py-3 mt-4">Personal Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect personal data only in the following case:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3 class="h6 mt-4">
            Communicating with us through feedback or support request.
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you provide feedback or request support via email, we collect
            your email address, your sender name, and your message content.
            Additionally, if you launch an email app directly from the App, we
            may also collect personal data such as the App version, the OS
            version, and your device model, which are automatically added to the
            email body. You are not required to provide this personal data.
            However, if you choose not to do so, we may not be able to respond
            to your requests properly.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="h4 py-3 mt-4">Our Use of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        We use personal data to respond to communications and to improve the
        App’s functionality. We will not use personal data for any other
        purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h4 py-3 mt-4">Our Sharing of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share personal data with others. However, we may disclose your
        personal data where there is a legally binding request from an
        authority.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 py-3 mt-4">Privacy Questions</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, or you would like to
        request the disclosure or deletion of your personal data, please contact
        us by <a href="mailto:support@shudev.app">email</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is a material change to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post a
        notice on this website at least a week in advance of doing so. We
        recommend that you review this Privacy Policy regularly.
